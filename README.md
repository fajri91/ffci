## FFCI: A framework for interpretable automatic evaluation of summarization

### About

FFCI is a framework for fine-grained summarization evaluation that comprises four elements: faithfulness (degree of factual consistency with the source),
focus (precision of summary content relative to the reference), coverage (recall of summary content relative to the reference), and inter-sentential coherence (document fluency between adjacent sentences).
