## FFCI: A framework for interpretable automatic evaluation of summarization

### About

FFCI is a framework for fine-grained summarization evaluation that comprises four elements: **F**aithfulness (degree of factual consistency with the source),
**F**ocus (precision of summary content relative to the reference), **C**overage (recall of summary content relative to the reference), and **I**nter-sentential coherence (document fluency between adjacent sentences).

### Notes
I am currently in an internship, and has been delayed to clean and upload the experiment repo. In case you need something from our experiment. Please dont hesitate to email us. The email is in the paper. Thanks! :)
