## FFCI: A framework for interpretable automatic evaluation of summarization

### About

FFCI is a framework for fine-grained summarization evaluation that comprises four elements: **F**aithfulness (degree of factual consistency with the source),
**F**ocus (precision of summary content relative to the reference), **C**overage (recall of summary content relative to the reference), and **I**nter-sentential coherence (document fluency between adjacent sentences).
