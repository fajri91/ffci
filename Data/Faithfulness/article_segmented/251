the two teams faced off in patras, greece, earlier this month, with european title contenders greece running out winners, 92-64.
three members of that team will be missing at the copper box, however, offering gb a chance of revenge.
"i think it's going to be amazing - i'm from stratford so i love playing there [at the copper box]," said gb guard teddy okereafor.
"this is the level we need to be playing at to make sure we're 100% ready for eurobasket this year.
"we've got a couple of guys who are going to be playing for the first time in london so it's going to be exciting for them - i think the atmosphere's going to be great."
the game will be britain's only home game before they compete at fiba eurobasket 2017, which starts at the beginning of september with a qualifying group in istanbul, turkey.
after they play greece, coach joe prunty's team travel to a four-team tournament in poland, their last warm-up games before eurobasket starts.
