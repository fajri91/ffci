it was the 29-year-old spaniard's first grand tour stage win and movistar's first at this year's giro - still led by jungels, with geraint thomas second.
thomas' team sky team-mate mikel landa's late attack was caught as time gaps in the top 10 stayed the same.
thomas is six seconds behind jungels, with fellow briton adam yates third.
orica-scott rider yates is 10 seconds behind quick-step's jungels, on the same time as favourites nairo quintana and vincenzo nibali, who also finished safely in the main bunch on saturday.
landa had built up a lead of 15 seconds on jungels - a gap that would have seen him climb into the overall lead - before being reeled back by the peloton on the up-and-down finish into peschici.
sunday's stage takes the riders into the high mountains for the first time since stage four, with a summit finish on the category-one blockhaus ending a relatively flat 149km from montenero di bisaccia.
