people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta) wants the mascot to be replaced with a modern animal-friendly version.
the group has suggested a fish with the slogan skegness - a happy plaice.
the mayor of skegness said all suggestions were welcome but said he did not think there would be much support for jolly to be axed.
the original jolly fisherman poster was commissioned by the great northern railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to skegness.
the poster featured the slogan "skegness is so bracing".
it was commissioned in 1908 for 12 guineas and has became synonymous with the lincolnshire resort.
however, dawn carr, of peta, said jolly "evokes images of cruelty to animals".
"fish being tricked into impaling themselves in the mouth, animals being pulled out of the ocean in giant nets where they are so crushed together the pressure pushes their stomachs out through their mouths and their eyes pop out."
"this is what the jolly fisherman represents," she said.
she said peta's suggestion would give the resort an opportunity to rebrand itself as a progressive holiday destination.
"one where the mutilation and killing of sea animals is not being celebrated."
skegness's mayor, carl macey, said the jolly fisherman was loved by adults and children alike.
he said: "animal cruelty is something we don't want to be portrayed for, but i don't feel jolly has ever come across in that manner.
"he is just accepted as happy and friendly and he does such a wonderful job for skegness.
"it [peta's suggestion] will go before council, but if it isn't broken we won't try and fix it."
