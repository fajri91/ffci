the seasiders struck with the first real chance after 12 minutes as nathan delfouneso jinked past his man and delivered a pinpoint chip into the area, where jamille matt turned the ball home from three yards.
blackpool goalkeeper sam slocombe denied matthew briggs with a sensational save to push the ball behind after 17 minutes, but the visitors did equalise from the resulting corner as kurtis guthrie prodded in from close range after a goalmouth scramble.
somehow, colchester failed to re-take the lead on the stroke of half-time as slocombe produced a brilliant save from george elokobi's close-range effort, before guthrie headed against the bar from two yards.
blackpool should have clinched the win 15 minutes from time, as tom aldred was found unmarked from a corner, but he headed wide from eight yards.
colchester finished the game with 10 men, after substitute sean murray was shown a straight red for a bad tackle on jim mcalister in injury time.
