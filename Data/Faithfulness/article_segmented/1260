greater manchester fire and rescue service (gmfrs) visited the premises nine times in the last 12 months.
geoff harris, gmfrs area manager, said: "the site operators, asset and land, have been broadly compliant with fire safety legislation throughout that time."
the fire service raised concerns to the ea in february over the impact a fire could have on nearby residents, transport and the environment.
"the ea were very interested in our concerns, which resulted in our fire safety officers conducting joint visits to the site with ea staff, the ea decided to take enforcement action against the site operators," mr harris said.
an ea spokesman said: "after consideration of all the facts relating to the company and the site, the ea has now decided to revoke the environmental permit.
"subject to any appeal, the revocation takes effect on 7 august, which means after that date the company will no longer be able to operate from that site.
the company is still required to remove all the waste."
the cause of the fire remains undetermined.
