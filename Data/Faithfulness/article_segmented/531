it had been reported that the energy drinks giant was considering a £200m offer for the premier league club.
sullivan and gold bought a majority stake in west ham in 2010 in a deal that valued the club at £105m.
between them they now own more than 85% of the club.
since august's move to london stadium, west ham have also been linked with takeovers from qatari and chinese groups.
last year sullivan said it was possible a minority shareholding could be sold to clear debts but that he and gold intended the ownership to pass on to their children.
