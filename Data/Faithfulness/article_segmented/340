det insp richard baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property.
he said: "a joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out.
"enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances.
