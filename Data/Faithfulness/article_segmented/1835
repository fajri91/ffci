the men entered the post office in quarrywood avenue, in the barmulloch area, at 07:55 on friday.
they threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash.
the 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.
both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper.
det sgt raymond hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting cctv images from the surrounding area.
he added: "there are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
"i am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry."
