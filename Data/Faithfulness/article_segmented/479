earlier this year a team of six detectives began conducting a complete review of mr deely's disappearance.
cctv footage from the night he went missing was enhanced using specialist technology.
it shows mr deely talking to a man dressed in black outside the bank of ireland on baggot street, where he worked.
it is understood he was returning to get an umbrella after the party.
detectives released the footage in april and appealed for the man to come forward.
they believe he was the same man captured on cctv following mr deely, who was from county kildare in the republic of ireland, a short time later on haddington road.
on saturday gardaí said the man seen in the cctv has not yet been identified and they renewed their appeal for him to come forward.
