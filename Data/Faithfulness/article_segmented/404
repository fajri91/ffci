the friesians were found in dolwen, near old colwyn, on friday after eating poisonous tree clippings dumped in a farmer's field.
north wales police said the culprit is described as a heavily built man, aged 50 to 60, with curly brown hair, driving a dark blue pick-up truck.
anyone with information can call 101.
"apparently he has been dumping clippings over past two weeks.
has to be living/working local to colwyn bay," sgt rob taylor, of the rural crime team, tweeted on sunday.
a post-mortem examination showed the cows, aged 16 months, died as a result of toxins found in yew and leylandii tree cuttings.
sgt taylor said he was "appalled" by the "atrocious" act of fly-tipping and praised the "impressive" response to his appeal for information on social media.
