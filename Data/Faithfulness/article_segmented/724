"our goalkeeper was knocked out for a spell and we picked up a couple of other injuries [at sunderland] but we dealt with that well," said ferguson, who did not start with returning england players wayne rooney, danny welbeck and tom cleverley on saturday.
"there will be changes at chelsea.
we will have to wait and see how wayne is.
he was a bit tired after getting back from the england match.
"we will have ryan giggs and javier hernandez available and there were a couple of others [including rio ferdinand] who i did not take to sunderland.
"it was a battle in the second half but in the first half we played very well and deserved to be in front, and you have to give credit to sunderland.
"they had a real go at us and made it much more difficult for us but we owe our win to determined defending and a lot of courage."
