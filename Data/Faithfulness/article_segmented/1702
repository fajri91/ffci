gb taekwondo chief gary hall said that, like his sister jade, the teenager is "a good character".
hall added: "he hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients."
the 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the austrian open in june.
performance director hall added: "this group is really strong.
we have done [the fighting chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had.
"they will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the austrian open, to see how they perform.
"if they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them."
