head coach warren gatland is leading the british and irish lions in new zealand and has named interim coach rob howley as part of his backroom team.
forwards coach mcbryde assumes head coach responsibilities for the third time after leading wales on tours in 2009 and 2013.
"it is an honour to represent your country and to do so overseas carries extra responsibility," said mcbryde.
"for me it is another exciting opportunity to lead the team.
 it is something i have thoroughly enjoyed in the past and i'm really looking forward to doing it again at the end of the season."
the welsh rugby union (wru) will appoint assistant coaches for the summer tour to assist mcbryde.
"we are also at an advanced stage in discussions with a number of other individuals about the summer tour and hope to be in a position to confirm the full make-up of the management team next week," said wru chief executive martyn phillips.
union chairman gareth davies, who is also on the lions' selection panel, believes the involvement of welsh coaches will benefit the national team.
"2017 is a real summer of opportunity for welsh coaches and should benefit the whole of welsh rugby in the years ahead," he said.
"it is not often that you get the opportunity to develop coaches in different environments.
"our coaches and players have been invigorated by their lions experiences on previous campaigns and there is little doubt that a tour of new zealand will provide the ultimate test and so once again both mentally stimulate and inspire each individual."
