scientists and charities say the human papilloma virus (hpv) jab will protect them from head and neck cancers.
hpv is sexually transmitted and girls aged 12 and 13 receive the vaccine to protect them against cervical cancer.
the welsh government said it is waiting for advice from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation.
charities including tenovus cancer care and organisations such as bma cymru and cardiff university's hpv research team will deliver a letter to the welsh government on monday calling for the vaccination to be rolled out.
they told bbc radio wales' eye on wales programme the number of head and neck cancer cases are increasing.
dr mererid evans, consultant oncologist at velindre hospital in cardiff, said: "i've seen a difference in demographics over the last ten years.
"these are younger people with families, and three-quarters of those affected are men.
the average age is 55 and most are non-smokers."
jon antoniazzi, from tenovus cancer care, added: "hpv causes 5% of the global cancer burden.
"what the welsh government could be doing right now is taking a progressive step to stem the tide of these cancers, and show that it really takes the public health of its citizens seriously.
"we urge them to diverge from central thinking and vaccinate boys now."
in 2008, a vaccination programme was rolled out in schools and 85% of girls in wales have been vaccinated.
the welsh government said: "we will await the committee's recommendations and will consider the implications for wales of any proposed changes to the hpv vaccination programme."
