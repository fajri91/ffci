richard blake-smith and his partner anna beat vytautas kirkliauskas of lithuania, carrying his wife, neringa kirliauskiene.
rich said: "we put in a whole week's work, running around the athletics track near where we live - and it's paid off"
"we were pushed hard, especially by the lithuanians there."
competitors must tackle a 380-metre course, hurdling over haystacks, scrabbling up a steep slope, and dodging water pistols.
you don't need to be married to take part.
the race saw all combinations of competitors - men carrying women, men carrying men and one woman carrying a woman.
rich and anna will now compete at the world championships in finland in july.
