erin cross, from chester, received gene editing therapy in the usa after a â£100,000 appeal raised the cash.
doctors have told her parents she is now in remission after the therapy which took place in august.
her mother sarah cross said: "it means she is now able to have a bone marrow transplant in manchester."
she added: "i'm so glad i pushed for her to get on the trial here at seattle, if i hadn't she wouldn't be here today."
erin was treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia using car (chimaeric antigen receptor) t-cell therapy which re-engineers the cells in the lab to attack and kill cancer cells when injected back into the patient's body.
"we got a call from the hospital who told us the cancer cells have gone - we couldn't believe it as she has never come back clear from any treatment before," said ms cross.
"she is running round now like any six year old," she added.
erin is due to return to the uk within the next month for a transplant at the royal manchester children's hospital where a donor has already been found.
