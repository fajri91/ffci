the fight, adams' second as a professional and first in her home city for 20 years, will be over four three-minute rounds, rather than the usual two-minute rounds for women.
the flyweight voiced her frustration with two-minute rounds after beating virginia carcamo last month.
salazar, 18, has lost once in six professional contests.
adams, 34, says the extra minute in each round will give her a chance to try out things she has learnt in the gym.
she said: "i had two minutes to find my rhythm, distance and take out my opponent.
it's not enough time.
"i found, by the end of the rounds, i needed a couple more seconds and it would be over.
"now we have three minutes, i'm able to relax more, establish the jab, find the rhythm properly and really get in the swing of things."
