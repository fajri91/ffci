sara paretsky was chosen for the outstanding contribution to crime fiction award after her 23-year career writing about vi warshawski, a female private investigator from chicago.
actress kathleen turner played vi warshawski in a 1991 movie based on the deadlock novel and in a bbc radio 4 adaptation.
vi warshawski was "a real game changer", cleeves said. "
this was a woman who didn't just solve crimes but was like an action hero in a sense."
paretsky "really changed the way that readers thought about female writers", cleeves said.
"when she started writing, it was pretty well unheard of to have a strong female protagonist," she added.
paretsky also set up sisters in crime, an organisation to support female crime writers around the world.
