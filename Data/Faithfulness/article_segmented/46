there have been a number of shootings in sheffield in recent weeks, although all the previous incidents have been in the north of the city and not close to the upperthorpe area.
on monday, a 25-year-old man was seriously injured when he was shot in the street in the shiregreen area.
earlier this month, an elderly couple were left shocked when shots were fired through their living room window in the southey green area - an incident police believe was a case of mistaken identity.
in january shots were fired at houses in two separate incidents in the same street in high green.
