jonathan rees qc said the alleged failure of ms rose, of newham, east london, to detect vinnie's swollen optic discs during the routine test, and refer him on for further investigation, was "at the heart of the prosecution case".
a build-up of fluid in his brain increased pressure in vinnie's skull and ultimately led to his death, the court heard.
"the prosecution allege that vinnie's death was preventable and would have been prevented had the defendant, ms rose, done her job properly," he told the jury.
"given the risk of death involved, her conduct was so bad in all of the circumstances - it fell so far below the standards to be expected of a competent optometrist - that it was criminal."
the trial continues.
