mr charney, who also founded the company, was ousted last year because of the employee complaints and amid accusations of misuse of company funds.
in the san francisco court filing, the board said it did not expect him ever to return to the firm.
mr charney's lawyer said many of the statements made were false.
"the company has engaged in an invasion of mr charney's privacy in a shameful attempt to extort him and gain leverage over him," said his lawyer keith fink.
the court filing documents evidence of illicit emails written to female employees by the former chief executive, as well as racially derogatory taunts.
they come in response to mr charney's defamation lawsuit against the company and its chair.
mr charney "repeatedly engaged in conduct that violated the company's sexual harassment and anti-discrimination policy," the company's papers say.
"given this set of facts... it would be hard to find any board of any company... that would be willing to hire mr charney as its ceo, executive, or employee.
the risk to the company and its shareholders would just be too great," the board adds.
earlier this month, american apparel was granted a restraining order preventing him from making any negative statements in the press about the company and from trying to get board members removed.
