french-based sanofi closed its drug manufacturing site in fawdon in 2015 with the loss of 450 jobs.
now, accord healthcare is to use the plant for its pharmaceutical production, with the hope many of the jobs will be filled by ex-sanofi staff.
a spokesman said the firm was confident the investment would have an "extremely positive" impact on the area.
the leader of newcastle city council, councillor nick forbes, said: "this announcement is fantastic news for newcastle and the north east and helps strengthen our reputation as a home for the science and healthcare sector.
"accord is a global player in the pharmaceutical industry and the highly skilled jobs and long-term investment bring a welcome boost the local economy."
accord healthcare develops, manufactures and distributes more than 130 pharmaceutical products to about 60 countries worldwide.
