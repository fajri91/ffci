ryan walls took pictures of 101 passengers during the edinburgh festival in 2015.
the 42-year-old said only two people refused out of the 103 people he asked due to being in a hurry and having a bad hair day.
now the father-of-three's pictures will go on display at out of the blue drill hall, dalmeny street, in august.
mr walls told the bbc scotland news website how he took photographs of a hen party, stag do, football fans, a chef, a high court judge and a tv agony aunt from kuwait.
he said: "everyone was so nice.
one of the pictures is of a passenger who was in such a hurry that he couldn't wait for another taxi when i discovered the central locking system was broken so i had to pull him in and out of the taxi window.
"i also had an elderly former english teacher who had suddenly decided she wanted to go out to a show at the festival at the last minute and she had lots of words of encouragement for me so i really enjoyed chatting with her.
"i also got a jambo fan and was worried i wasn't going to get a hibs fan but luckily i did.
"i'm really interested in people and wanted to capture that moment in my cab, i only had seconds to take a few pictures and i'm really pleased with the end result."
the exhibition runs from 31 july until 5 august.
