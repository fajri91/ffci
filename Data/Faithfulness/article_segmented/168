lilliard gin is based at the born in the borders visitor centre in jedburgh.
it comes ahead of a number proposals, which are at various stages of the planning process, to open the region's first whisky distillery since 1837.
lead distiller kate macinnes said the potential to make the scottish borders a "region of distilling excellence" was "really exciting".
"our gin production is on a completely different scale to the other distilleries in development," she said.
"our still is one of the smallest production stills in the uk, and our entire operation fits into a cowshed, but if people like our gin, that's all that matters.
"we have a rich abundance of wild food on our doorstep in the teviot valley, and lilliard gin aims to capture that and convey a true sense of the local flavour palette and our borders 'terroir'."
john henderson, of born in the borders, said the gin distillery was a natural companion to the scottish borders brewery on the site.
"to be able to play host to the first new distillery in the borders in nearly 200 years is incredible," he said.
"and the fact that lilliard gin are looking to use borders botanicals means they are completely in tune with our own ethos of local sourcing.
"we just can't wait for them to get started, and to taste their gin."
the gin takes its name from a legendary borders figure.
"lilliard was the heroine of the battle of ancrum moor in 1545, fought just north of the distillery," explained ms macinnes.
"lilliard reputedly fought to avenge the death of her lover at the hands of the english.
the battle site is also known as lilliard's edge.
"we wanted a name that reflected our landscape, and our strong female production team, and lilliard seemed like a natural choice."
